This project is written in C# with 2 applications, one a console base, the other a windows-form. This project comes with 2 types of applications, an HL7 Compliant Service (the Console Application), and a Consumer of the Service (The Windows-Form Application). The Service calculates Tax based on which province/territory of Canada that you provide. Communications to and from the Service comply with the HL7 protocol.
